# Weather App
A simple weather app made in one of my classes that uses the following:
- [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/)
- [OpenWeather Geocoding API](https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api)
- [OpenWeather Current API](https://openweathermap.org/current)
- Icons are from [flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/). More info in the public/css/images/souces.txt

## How to use?
Download the files
```bash
git clone https://github.com/oli-moreau/weather-app.git
```
Change the API key to your own on line 22 in js/main.js
```bash
const api_key = '&appid=your_api_key'
```
Run the index.html through VSCode Live Preview (or similar)
```bash
>Live Preview: Start Server
```
